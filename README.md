```

## **Vercel Deployment**

This project is configured for easy deployment on Vercel. The `vercel.json` file at the root of the repository specifies how incoming requests are handled.

-   The `rewrites` rule in `vercel.json` routes all requests to `/api/*` to the `api/usisvercel.py` serverless function.
-   Vercel automatically detects the React application in the `USIS/usis-frontend` directory and builds/serves it as the frontend.

To deploy to Vercel:

1.  Push your changes to the `main` branch of your connected GitHub repository.
2.  Vercel will automatically detect the push and trigger a new build and deployment.
3.  Once the deployment is complete, your application will be live at your Vercel project URL.

### ðŸš¨ Important: Clear Browser Cache After Deployment

After a new Vercel deployment, it is **highly recommended** to clear your browser's cache and cookies for the application's URL. This ensures that your browser loads the latest version of the frontend code, which is crucial for seeing recent changes and avoiding issues like outdated API endpoints being called.

## **Acknowledgements**
