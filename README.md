```

## **Vercel Deployment**

This project is configured for easy deployment on Vercel. The `vercel.json` file at the root of the repository specifies how incoming requests are handled.

-   The `rewrites` rule in `vercel.json` routes all requests to `/api/*` to the `api/usisvercel.py` serverless function.
-   Vercel automatically detects the React application in the `USIS/usis-frontend` directory and builds/serves it as the frontend.

To deploy to Vercel:

1.  Push your changes to the `main` branch of your connected GitHub repository.
2.  Vercel will automatically detect the push and trigger a new build and deployment.
3.  Once the deployment is complete, your application will be live at your Vercel project URL.

### ðŸš¨ Important: Clear Browser Cache After Deployment

After a new Vercel deployment, it is **highly recommended** to clear your browser's cache and cookies for the application's URL. This ensures that your browser loads the latest version of the frontend code, which is crucial for seeing recent changes and avoiding issues like outdated API endpoints being called.

## **Acknowledgements**

-   Based on the USIS course data structure.
-   Utilizes open-source libraries like React, Flask, Axios, date-fns, and html2canvas.

## **Contact**

For any questions, issues, or feedback, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.

## **Future Enhancements**

-   [ ] Dark mode support
-   [ ] Mobile responsiveness improvements
-   [ ] More advanced conflict resolution algorithms
-   [ ] Integration of course prerequisites checking
-   [ ] Analysis of GPA impact based on routine choices
-   [ ] Export routine to other formats (e.g., PDF, iCal)
-   [ ] Multi-language support

- AI-assisted routine generation
- Exam conflict detection
- Schedule compatibility checking
- Time slot management
- Lab schedule handling
- AI-powered routine feedback

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/courses` - Get list of all available courses
- `GET /api/course_details` - Get detailed information about a specific course
- `GET /api/faculty` - Get list of all faculty members
- `GET /api/faculty_for_courses` - Get faculty members for specific courses
- `GET /api/exam_schedule` - Get exam schedule for a specific course section

### Routine Generation

## Key Functions

### Time Management
```python
class TimeUtils:
    @staticmethod
    def convert_to_bd_time(time_str)
    # Converts time string to Bangladesh timezone
    
    @staticmethod
    def time_to_minutes(tstr)
    # Converts time string to minutes (handles both 24-hour and 12-hour formats)
    
    @staticmethod
    def minutes_to_time(minutes)
    # Converts minutes to time string in 24-hour format (HH:MM:SS)
```

### Exam Conflict Management
```python
class ExamConflictChecker:
    @staticmethod
    def check_conflicts(sections)
    # Checks for conflicts between mid-term and final exams of sections
    
    @staticmethod
    def format_conflict_message(conflicts)
    # Formats exam conflicts message in a concise way
```

### Schedule Compatibility Functions
```python
def check_schedule_compatibility(schedule1, schedule2)
# Checks if two schedules are compatible (no time conflicts)

def is_valid_combination(sections)
# Checks if a combination of sections has any schedule conflicts

def filter_section_by_time(section, selected_times)
# Checks if section schedules fit within selected time ranges
```

### Lab Schedule Management
```python
def get_lab_schedule(section)
# Extracts and formats lab schedule information, supporting both array and nested object formats

def get_lab_schedules_flat(section)
# Normalizes labSchedules to a flat array of schedules
```

### AI Integration
```python
def try_ai_routine_generation(valid_combination, selected_days, selected_times, commute_preference)
# Generates AI-assisted routine using Gemini AI

def get_routine_feedback_for_api(routine, commute_preference=None)
# Gets AI feedback on a generated routine
```

### Scoring and Optimization
```python
def calculate_routine_score(combination, selected_days, selected_times, commute_preference)
# Calculates a score for a routine combination based on various factors

def calculate_campus_days(combination)
# Calculates the total number of unique days a student needs to be on campus
```

## Environment Setup
Required environment variables:
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY` - Google Gemini AI API key
- `PORT` - Server port (default: 5000)

## Dependencies
- Flask
- Flask-CORS
- google.generativeai
- pytz
- requests
- demjson3

## Error Handling
The API includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Invalid input data
- Missing environment variables
- API connection issues
- Schedule conflicts
- Time format issues
- Lab schedule inconsistencies

## Best Practices
1. Always check exam conflicts before time conflicts
2. Handle both class and lab schedules appropriately
3. Consider commute preferences in routine optimization
4. Validate time formats and ranges
5. Use proper error handling for API responses

## Response Formats
All API endpoints return JSON responses with the following structure:
- Success: `{"data": {...}}` or `{"routine": [...], "feedback": "..."}`
- Error: `{"error": "error message"}`

## Time Slot Format
Time slots are handled in both 24-hour and 12-hour formats:
- 24-hour: "HH:MM:SS"
- 12-hour: "HH:MM AM/PM"

## Lab Schedule Format
Supports two formats:
1. Array format: `[{day, startTime, endTime}, ...]`
2. Nested object: `{classSchedules: [{day, startTime, endTime}, ...]}`
